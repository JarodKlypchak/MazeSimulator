# MazeSimulator

A Maze Generator and Runner made to implement Depth First Search and Breadth First Search.

## Goals

The goal of this project was to learn some basics of JavaScript, primarily drawing to the canvas object, to create simple graphics.

Another goal of this project was to experiment with the different search algorithms (Breadth and Depth first) in an interesting way.

## Implementation

This project was implemented utilizing ideas from cellular automota, processing each space in the grid of the maze as it's own individual
cell, with it's own state.
